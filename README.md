# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that provides an interactive and visual representation of various sorting algorithms. The project aims to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by dynamically displaying the sorting process step by step.

## Features

- Interactive Interface: Users can choose the size of the array, adjust the speed of the sorting process, and select from a range of sorting algorithms.
- Visual Representation: The application provides a graphical representation of the array being sorted, with bars representing individual array elements.
- Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Includes several commonly used sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Algorithm Details: Detailed information about each sorting algorithm, including time complexity, space complexity, best-case, and worst-case scenarios.
- Smooth Animations: The sorting process is animated to ensure a smooth and visually appealing experience for the users.
